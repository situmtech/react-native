## What's in here <a name="whatsinhere"/>

Situm SDK is a set of utilities that allow any developer to build location based apps using Situm's indoor positioning system.
Among many other capabilities, apps developed with Situm SDK will be able to:

1. Obtain information related to buildings where Situm's positioning system is already configured:
   floor plans, points of interest, geotriggered events, etc.
2. Retrieve the location of the smartphone inside these buildings (position, orientation, and floor
   where the smartphone is).
3. Compute a route from a point A (e.g. where the smartphone is) to a point B (e.g. any point of
   interest within the building).

## How to run the app <a name="howtorun"/>

### Step 1: Install the dependencies <a name="dependencies"/>

The first step is to download this repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/situmtech/situm-react-native-plugin.git
```

And then install this sample app dependecies as follows:

```bash
cd example/
npm install
#OR
yarn
```

### Step 2: Set your credentials <a name="config"/>

For this step you must create a situm account, so [setup your account](../README.md#setup-your-account) before continuing.
After creating your situm account, you can set your credentials on the properties of [`src/situm.tsx`](./src/situm.tsx), like so:

```js
export const SITUM_EMAIL = '';
export const SITUM_API_KEY = '';
export const SITUM_BUILDING_ID = ''; // Identifier of the building
export const SITUM_FLOOR_ID = ''; // Identifier of the floor
```

**NOTE**: You should also fill the [SITUM_BUILDING_ID](https://situm.com/docs/sdk-cartography/#building-identifier) and [SITUM_FLOOR_ID](https://situm.com/docs/sdk-cartography/#floor-identifier) variables so all the examples are able to work as expected. In case you haven't created POIs or paths yet, learn [how to create these cartography elements](https://situm.com/docs/sdk-cartography/#sdk-a-basic-complete-cartography-example).

### Step 3: Setup Google Maps <a name="mapsapikey"/>

You may need to configure an API KEY in order to be able to use Google Maps on your app.

Please follow steps provided on [Google Maps for iOS](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios-sdk/get-api-key?hl=en) to generate an API
Key.

**NOTE**: When generating an API key, you can restrict it to iOS & Android and use the same key for both platforms.

- **iOS**

  When you've successfully generated the key, go to [`ios/example/AppDelegate.mm`](ios/example/AppDelegate.mm) file and initialize Google Maps as shown:

```objc
#import <GoogleMaps/GoogleMaps.h>
...

- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions
{
    [GMSServices provideAPIKey:@"HERE_GOES_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY"];
}
```

- **Android**

  Go to [`android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`](android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml) file and add Google Maps API key as a `meta-data` inside the `application` section.

```xml
    <meta-data
        android:name="com.google.android.geo.API_KEY"
        android:value="HERE_GOES_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY" />
```

### Step 4: Run the app <a name="runapplication"></a>

#### Android

- **Run from command line:** `$ react-native run-android`
- **Run from Android Studio:** Open `root/android` folder in Android Studio and run project.

#### iOS

- **Run from command line:** `$ react-native run-ios`
- **Run from XCode:** Go to `root/ios` folder and open `SitumRNGettingStarted.xcworkspace` or run command `xed ios` from root directory.

## Documentation <a name="documentation"/>

More information on how to use the official React Native plugin and the set of APIs, the functions, parameters and results each function accepts and provides can be found in our [Cordova JSDoc](https://developers.situm.com/sdk_documentation/cordova/jsdoc/latest/situm) which shares interfaces.

### Examples

In case you want to learn how to use our plugin, you may want to take a look at our code samples of the basics functionalities:

1. [**Positioning**](https://github.com/situmtech/situm-react-native-plugin/blob/feature/update-SDK-2.83.7/example/src/examples/Positioning.tsx): Learn how to start positioning and get the user location by using our listener with the specified positioning configuration inside [`src/settings.tsx`](./src/settings.tsx) file.
2. [**Positioning with Remote Configuration**](https://github.com/situmtech/situm-react-native-plugin/blob/feature/update-SDK-2.83.7/example/src/examples/RemoteConfig.tsx): Learn how to start positioning with the [remote configuration](https://situm.com/docs/sdk-remote-configuration/) defined in the settings section inside our [dashboard](https://dashboard.situm.com/settings). This way you can manage your positioning parameters with ease and avoid doing several code changes to test different configurations.

4. [**Show a building full info from different calls**](https://github.com/situmtech/situm-react-native-plugin/blob/feature/update-SDK-2.83.7/example/src/examples/InfoFromBuilding.tsx): Learn how to retrive all the information related to a building in different calls. (e.g. floors, pois, geofences, custom fields, ...)
5. [**Draw a building in top of google maps**](https://github.com/situmtech/situm-react-native-plugin/blob/feature/update-SDK-2.83.7/example/src/examples/ShowBuildingOnMap.tsx): Draw a building above google maps.
6. [**Show a building's full info**](https://github.com/situmtech/situm-react-native-plugin/blob/feature/update-SDK-2.83.7/example/src/examples/BuildingFullInfo.tsx): Learn how to fetch all the information related to a building with just one call.
